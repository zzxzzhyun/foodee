# FooDee
 
Foodie provides recommendations for healthy food choices tailored to specific diseases.

The database was created by merging data or database listed below.
1. Small Molecule Pathway Database ([SMPDB](http://smpdb.ca/))
2. Food Database ([FooDB](https://foodb.ca/))
3. [Entrez Gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene)
4. NCBI [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/)
5. [OMIM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/) disease data

It provides five main functions:
1. Find compounds related to a disease
2. Recommend healthy food specific to a disease
3. Discover health effects of a compound
4. Get a list of food with specific compound
5. Get compound description

## Note #1
Some compounds or foods may not play a substantial role in the drug-action pathway of a disease. So, foods listed in our recommendations should be consumed under careful consideration. Please use this as a informative starting point for understanding the association between specific compounds and diseases, as well as the corresponding food sources in which these compounds can be found!

## Note #2 
Unfortunately, I do not own a server so the database cannot be accessed. If you want to run these files properly, contact me for the source files.
